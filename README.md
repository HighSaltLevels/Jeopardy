# Jeopardy
Jeopardy game that pulls questions from officially aired games

I got this idea because I watch the Twitch streamer / Youtuber Northernlion, and he had decided to make this same program. He accomplished this in C# and compiled it for Windows, however, I decdided that I could make this program, and hopefully do it even better. I plan to write it in Python and compile it for Windows and Linux.

This is still a work in progress, but I hope to have it done soon. Until then, enjoy what I have now...
